## Logistic Regression Classifier

### Model Fitting:
- A logistic regression model is fitted to predict the market direction (Up or Down) using Lag1 through Lag5 and Volume.
- The resulting model, including coefficients, standard errors, test-statistics, and p-values, is printed for comprehensive understanding.

### Association Analysis:
- An assessment is made regarding the association between Lag1 and Direction, justifying the findings.

### Predicted Probabilities:
- Predicted probabilities for the first ten observations are calculated using the fitted model.

### Class Labels:
- Predicted probabilities are converted into class labels (Up or Down) based on a threshold of 0.5.
- Class labels for the first ten observations are displayed.

### Model Evaluation:
- A confusion matrix is generated to assess the logistic regression model's performance.
- Key metrics such as predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed and presented.
